# Scientific Python Exercises
## Libraries Used: Sympy, Numpy, Matplotlib

My answers to some scientific programming related Python exercises are contained in 
python_syntax_practice_1.py, python_syntax_practice2.py, solving_diff_eq.py, and 3D_and_parametric_plots.py 

python_syntax_practice_1.py and python_syntax_practice2.py showcase usage of basic Python functionality to solve 
simple math problems, such as summing all the primes up to a specified natural number. In solving_diff_eq.py, 
sympy is used to solve differential equations. In 3D_and_parametric_plots.py, numpy and matplotlib are used
in conjunction to plot surfaces and parametric curves.

To run these files, one option is to first download the Anaconda distribution at 
https://www.anaconda.com/download. This software contains several Python related tools. After installation is
finished, look for Spyder in the navigator and launch it. Spyder is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
that displays three core windows: the workplace (left), the console (bottom right), and plot/file window 
(top right). The workplace is where you can edit Python scripts. The console is where you can write 
commands to interact with scripts after running them. The plot/file window displays your directories and the 
plots that you create.

After opening Spyder, download these four files and open them within Spyder. For any given script that you would
like to run, press the "play" button on the top to run the module. Afterwards, run any given function in the 
console. For example, after downloading 3D_and_parametric_plots.py and opening it within Spyder, I press the 
"play" button to run the file. In the console, I type plotA(), which plots y = 3*x**3 + 2*x**2 - 5 in the plot
window. Each of these functions plotA(), plotB(), etc. refer to a different exercise and therefore plot 
a different surface/curve. A unique capital letter in the function signifies a unique plot. This naming 
scheme is also used in solving_diff_eq.py.

For your information, here is the output for each of the functions (excluding helpers like plotDh1) in 
3D_and_parametric_plots.py:

### Plot A
